# Instructions

This document contains information, questions, R code, and plots.

*Hints and reminders are bold*

<span style="color:blue"> Questions appear in blue. </span>

```{r warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# R code looks like this.
# Comments are in grey and explain the code

```

outputs from R appear like the above ^^^^

You should work through the exercise in groups and write answers in a separate document to be submitted on Blackboard by **Friday 5th Feb midnight (or another date)**. 

Answer all questions. The assignment can be written in any format 
(e.g. `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.R`) but
should easily be able to include pictures, R code, and text. 

# Rationale:

To complete this exercise you will need to use:

* The theory you have been taught in the
lectures
* The R code you have been given in the intro
* The R help pages and google
* Some biological knowledge
* A bit of creativity and problem solving

The exercise is designed to use statistical theory in an applied context
to solve biology related problems similar to those you will face in real 
life.**This week the exercise looks at how we can use maximum likelihood 
estimation to
make biological and political conclusions.** 
These exercises will get you to use
all steps in statistical modelling (choosing models, estimating parameters, 
estimating uncertainty, and interpretation of results.)

We will give some help with R and some hints, these will reduce each week.
We also expect you to use some problem solving yourselves and to ask the
assistants for help. 

We would expect this to take you at least 2 hours. 

# R hints and help

## Use the help pages and google

In the exam you will be given the R help pages for any function that is used. 
Here you can practice using them. Type `?` followed by the function name to 
bring up
the help pages for that function e.g. 

```{r OptimalHelp, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?optimise
```

For the function `optimise()` that we use this week. 

# A new R function we will use `optimise()`

This function provides an easy way for us to optimise over a parameter 
(find the 'best' value).
What we consider the 'best' value of a parameter depends on what criteria 
we want to optimise.
For most of the work we are doing we want to find the parameter that 
maximises the likelihood.
We can use optimise to calculate the likelihood for all possible values of a 
parameter (within bounds we set)
and find the maximum of these.

Arguments we have to provide to `optimise()` (the arguments optimise takes):

* `f`, the function to be optimised, for us that is the likelihood.
* `lower`,  the lower bound of parameter values to try.
* `upper`,  the upper bound of parameter values to try.
* `maximum`, TRUE or FALSE, whether to maximise or minimise the function.
We want to maximise.
* Other arguments. We also need to include any other arguments the 
function in f needs, as well as the one we want to find the optimum of. 
**More detail on these later.** 

## Other functions to remember from previous weeks

* `read.csv()`
* `hist()`
* `dbinom()`
* `plot()`
* `points()`
* `seq()`
* some other basic functions whose names say what they do: `sum()`, `mean()`,
 `length()`

# The challenge: management of dragons in Trondheim

**You are a team of scientists studying the reintroduction of dragons into 
Trondheim.**

Dragons were reintroduced last year as part of rewilding efforts. 
The exact species of dragon introduced is a seed eater and so no threat to 
people or livestock.
They also help maintain lower vegetation across the river, which helps 
kayakers and other river users.
Since reintroduction you have been collecting data on these dragons as part 
of your research. 
Now the government wants you to present your findings to help them choose a 
management strategy:

* 1) Business as usual (do nothing)
* 2) Manage the population negatively (shooting)
* 3) Manage the population positively (extra feeding or habitat creation)

From previous work you know that an average population abundance of 35 
individuals is needed 
to maintain the population and keep vegetation under control.
An average population abundance of more than 50 individuals will start to put 
pressure on resources
and increase risks of fire. 

**It is your job to analyse your data and advise the government how to manage 
the population.**

# Part A: analysis of the sex ratio of dragon eggs

![Dragon picture](Dragons.png)

One of your team has been collecting data on the sex of dragon eggs. 
Conveniently, male dragons are purple and females are red (even as eggs).

They have collected data from 100 eggs. 
Their data can be found at (https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2021v/Week03/DragonEggData.csv).
This file has a header and is a `.csv`. 
You can either download and then import it using read.csv() or import directly using the whole web address above. 

**DO NOT open the file in excel and re-save after downloading.**

The data has two columns `Egg_number` and `sex`. 
In the sex column 0 = male and 1 = female. 

*Remember: to access a particular column of a data frame you use 
$ e.g. sex_ratio_data$Egg_number*

**First thing we should always do is look at our data.**

<span style="color:blue"> A1. Plot a histogram of the data and look at the 
raw data in R. </span>

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

Use the `hist()` function to make the plot.

`xlab` and `ylab` and `main` 
arguments change the axis labels and plot title.

</details>

This is not a pretty graph but lets you see what sort of data you have. 

```{r ReadData, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# import the data and name it
SexRatioData <- read.csv('https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2021v/Week03/DragonEggData.csv', header=T) 

# plot the histogram - I have changed the title (main) and 
# the x axis label (xlab) manually
hist(SexRatioData$sex, xlab="Sex (0 = male, 1 = female)", 
     main = "Histogram of sex ratio data", col="black")
```

From this data you can calculate the observed proportion of female eggs:

<span style="color:blue"> A2. What is the proportion of female eggs in the 
observed data? (include one line on how you calculated it) </span>

```{r PlotStuff, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# There are several ways to do this. The exact way does not matter as long as it 
# is correct.

# create an object called ProportionFemale 

# Option 1:
# Sum the numbers in sex column (basically counts all the 1s) 
# then divide by the total number of trials (100)
# round() rounds the numbers, here to 2 decimal places.
ProportionFemale <- round(sum(SexRatioData$sex)/length(SexRatioData$sex),2) 

# Option 2: 
# We sum up the number of 1s and divide by the total number. 
# mean() is a sneaky way of doing this.
ProportionFemale <- mean(SexRatioData$sex)

# display answer
ProportionFemale # 0.44
```

Now you have the proportion of female eggs that were observed. But this does 
not tell us much. 
You need to complete some statistical analyses to make generalisable 
statements about the results.

**But which distribution can we use as a model?**

You want to choose a model to represent the data. Just like last week, this 
is binary data (male or female) and each egg
is an independent trial. It should be familiar that we can use the **binomial 
distribution** as our model.
As we have chosen the binomial distribution, you know that there is one 
unknown parameter to estimate $p$ = the 
probability of success (being female). 

**We have a model, how do we estimate the parameter?**     

<span style="color:blue"> A3i. Begin by **calculating** the likelihood for 
different probabilities of being female (here being female = getting a 
success). </span>

* You will need to create an object of your number of successes
* Work out your number of trials (how many times did you try to get a success?)
* Use the `dbinom()` function to find the density for different parameter values. 
In this case the density is the same as the likelihood (use ?dbinom if you can't remember what arguments it takes) 
* Try and change the x and y axis labels to something clearer than the defaults (use help and google to find out how)

<details><summary>Hint</summary>

You used `dbinom()` in the model this week just before Figure 1. 

You then plotted the likelihood in Figure 2. 
You can find the code for both there.

</details>

<span style="color:blue"> A3ii. Then **plot** the likelihood curve. </span>

```{r Binom, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# save the number of successes as an object
NSuccess <- sum(SexRatioData$sex) # 44
# save the number of trials as an object (total number of eggs)
NTrials <- length(SexRatioData$sex) # 100

# Help! what probabilites (probability of being female) do I use?
# You can use any but chosing a large number of possibilities covering 
# from almost 0 to almost 1 is best.
# seq() is a good function to use. 
# It creates a vector of sequence of numbers from the start and end you choose.
Probabilities <- seq(from=0.001, to=0.999, by=0.001) # 999 numbers

# generate likelihoods
likelihoods <- dbinom(x=NSuccess, size=NTrials, prob=Probabilities)

# plot the curve as a line (type="l")
# manually set x and y labels (xlab and ylab)
plot(x=Probabilities, y=likelihoods, type="l", xlab="Probability of female", 
     ylab="Likelihood") 
```

<span style="color:blue"> A4. At what point along the curve is the maximum 
likelihood estimate? and **How** can we find it, mathematically? 
(**hint: you can describe the mathematical process in words or use the 
equation**) </span>

Below is the code to find the maximum likelihood estimate of the probability 
of being female in R and plot it on the graph. You could also use the
equations from last week and find the maximum likelihood estimate 
analytically. 

But we present an example using `optimise()`, this is easier for more complex 
likelihoods.

```{r MLE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# f = the dbinom() function 

# You now add an upper and lower bound for the probability (0 and 1)
# R will only calculate the likelihood for parameter values between 0 and 1

# You still need to include the arguments of the number of successes
# and number of trials. dbinom() needs these to run

# You have set maximum to TRUE

MLE.binom <- optimise(f=dbinom, lower=0, upper=1, x=NSuccess, 
                      size=NTrials, maximum=TRUE)
# $maximum takes only the maximum value from the output

# Look at the result:
MLE.binom 
# $maximum = the parameter value that gave the highest likelihood
# $objective = the likelihood vlaue for that parameter

#+ warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE
# Now to plot the results

# Repeat the plot from A3ii
plot(x=Probabilities, y=likelihoods, type="l", xlab="Probability of female", 
     ylab="Likelihood") 

# add a point at the maximum likelihood

points(MLE.binom$maximum, # the parameter value
       MLE.binom$objective, # the maximum likelihood value
       col="red", pch=16) # pch = 16 and col = "red", makes the point red and filled in
```

You should now have a plot of the likelihoods and the probability (our
parameter) with the maximum likelihood.
Although you have managed to calculate this, it is not the whole picture.

<span style="color:blue"> A5. **Why** is the maximum likelihood estimate 
alone not enough to draw statistical conclusions? 
and **What** other information should we include? </span>
#'
**Below is the code to calculate the confidence intervals for the maximum 
likelihood estimate and plot them, using a normal approximation.** 

<span style="color:blue"> A6. **Write** a definition for the standard error. 
You can use equations but it must also include words. </span>


```{r Bonimal, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
r <- NSuccess  # number of successes
N <- NTrials # total number of trials
p <- NSuccess/NTrials # proportion of success (rounded)
phat <- r/N # get maximum likelihood estimate
stderr <- sqrt(phat*(1-phat)/N) # creating the standard error

# create normal approximation of likelihood
likelihoods.approx <- dnorm(Probabilities, phat, stderr) 
# scale this by the maximum likelihood (becomes relative likelihood)
# i.e. relative to the maximum calculated
likelihoods.approx <- likelihoods.approx/max(likelihoods.approx)

# plot the previous likelihood (binomial)
plot(x=Probabilities, y=likelihoods, type="l", ylab="Likelihood", xlab="Number of dragons")
# add a line for the new normal approximation likelihood
# need to multiply the relative likelhoods by the maximum from the binomial
lines(Probabilities, likelihoods.approx*max(likelihoods), col="red")

# calculate the lower and upper confidence intervals using the standard error
CI_lower <- MLE.binom$maximum - 1.96*stderr
CI_upper <- MLE.binom$maximum + 1.96*stderr
# display the rounded result
round(c(CI_lower, CI_upper), 2)

# mark the CIs on the plot - can do with lines, polygons or points
# I have chosen lines because it is simple code
abline(v=0.44) # MLE line
abline(v=c(CI_lower, CI_upper), col="red") # CI lines
# add text labels x and y tell R the coordinates to put text at
text(x=0.2, y=0.04, labels="Lower CI", col="red") 
text(x=0.7, y=0.04, labels="Upper CI", col="red")
```

Now, that you have estimated parameters and uncertainty, **it is time to 
interpret the results.** 

<span style="color:blue"> A7. Do the dragons have a skewed sex ratio as eggs 
(is it different to 50-50)?
Use the confidence intervals in your answer. **Explain your answer** </span>


### Part B: adult dragon numbers

Another member of your team has been collecting data on the number of adult 
dragons in Trondheim. 
They have set up a feeding station along the river. 
They have counted the number of dragons that visited the feeding station in a 
single day. 
The number of dragons they counted was **29**.

This is just a single count, if you repeated the count on more days each one 
would differ.
Just like the amount of land and sea we sampled differed each time we moved 
the globe.

**But which distribution can we use as a model?**

The data you have are counts, someone went out and counted dragons. Count 
data, can only be whole numbers (integers) that are always positive 
(non-negative). You cannot have half a dragon or negative dragons. 
The Poisson distribution also has these properties, therefore it is the 
appropriate choice.
So, here we assume that the count data has come from a 
**Poisson distribution**. 

In the same way as for binomial data, we want to find what parameter values 
(but this time for the Poisson distribution), which produce the highest
likelihood given our observed data, those that are most likely to give rise 
to our data.

Here you only have information on when you did see a dragon, 
not how many you did not see one (there is no record of failures). 

You need to save your number of observations as an object in R.

```{r ObsAb, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ObservedAbundance <- 29
```

# The Poisson distribution

The Poisson distribution is characterised by a single parameter. 
Lambda $latex \lambda $ which is the mean (and also the variance) of the 
distribution.
As with the binomial distribution (and $p$, the probability), 
we can also find the maximum likelihood estimate for the Poisson, 
but here we are finding the likelihood of different $latex \lambda $ (means).

**Below you can see the code to find the likelihoods of different 
$latex \lambda $ and then plot them.**

**Details are as follows:**

Remember: you can only have whole dragons.

* x is the observed count, in the same way observed successes was for the 
binomial. 
* Use the `dpois()` function to find the likelihoods 
(`dpois(x=ObservedData, lambda=TestLambdas)` or use ?dpois) 

```{r PoissonDist, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Begin by creating a sequence of lambdas to find likelihoods for
lambdas <- seq(1,70,1) # 70 lambdas (means)

# Calculate the likelihoods
likelihoods.Pois <- dpois(x=ObservedAbundance, lambdas)

# plot the outcome
plot(lambdas, likelihoods.Pois, type="l", ylab="Likelihood", xlab="Lambda (mean)")
```

To find the maximum likelihood we again use `optimise()`.


```{r EstPoiss, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# replot the outcome
plot(lambdas, likelihoods.Pois, type="l", ylab="Likelihood", xlab="Lambda (mean)")

# This time we use optimise on the dpois function used above
# Set lower and upper to the bounds of your lambdas above
MLE.Pois <- optimise(dpois, lower=0, upper=70, x = ObservedAbundance, 
                     maximum = TRUE)
MLE.Pois

# plot at point at the maximum likelihood 
points(MLE.Pois$maximum, # parameter value that gives the highest likelihood
       MLE.Pois$objective, # the actual likelihood value for that parameter
       col="blue", pch=16) 
```

You now have a maximum likelihood estimate for the mean abundance 
($\lambda$) of adult dragons in Trondheim.
As with the sex ratio though, this is not all of the information that we need 
for statistical inference. 
We would also like a measure of our confidence (uncertainty) in our estimate.

**The following code calculates the confidence intervals for the maximum 
likelihood estimate of $\lambda$**

Remember: the variance is the square of the standard deviation. `dnorm()` 
takes the standard deviation = sqrt(lambda).

```{r ApproxPoiss, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# calculate approximate likelihoods from the normal distribution
# mean is MLE from Poisson and standard deviation is square root of MLE Poisson
likelihoods.approx.Pois <- dnorm(lambdas, MLE.Pois$maximum,
                                 sqrt(MLE.Pois$maximum)) 
likelihoods.approx.Pois <- likelihoods.approx.Pois/max(likelihoods.approx.Pois)

plot(lambdas, likelihoods.Pois, type="l", ylab="Likelihood", xlab="Probability")
lines(lambdas, likelihoods.approx.Pois*max(likelihoods.Pois), col="blue")

stderr_Pois <- sqrt(MLE.Pois$maximum) # standard deviation as normal approximation
CI_lower <- MLE.Pois$maximum - 1.96*stderr_Pois
CI_upper <- MLE.Pois$maximum + 1.96*stderr_Pois
ApproxCI <- round(c(CI_lower, CI_upper),2)
ApproxCI

# Exact CIs by knowing the maths
## You do not need to know this!!! It's just here so we can plot them.
ExactCI <- qchisq(p=c(0.025, 0.975), df = 2*MLE.Pois$maximum)/2

# Mark on the plot - can do with lines, polygons or points
# This plots a polygon for the exact confidence intervals
InExactCI <- lambdas > ExactCI[1] & lambdas < ExactCI[2]

# This code shades the plot under the curve and between the exact confidence intervals
polygon(x=c(lambdas[InExactCI], max(lambdas[InExactCI]), min(lambdas[InExactCI])),
        y=c(likelihoods.Pois[InExactCI], 0,0), border=NA, col="grey70")

# YOU ONLY NEED TO KNOW HOW TO PLOT POLYGONS IF YOU ARE INTERESTED

# Then mark on the plot approximate intervals
# can do with lines, polygons or points
# This one is a line
abline(v=29) # MLE line
abline(v=c(CI_lower, CI_upper), col="blue") # CI lines
text(x=10, y=0.04, labels="Lower\nCI", col="blue")
text(x=50, y=0.04, labels="Upper\nCI", col="blue")

# Adds a legend (key) to the plot in the top right corner
# Labelled Exact CI and Approx CI, with a grey and blue filled square and no line around the edge (bty = 'n')
legend("topright", c("Exact CI", "Approx CI"), 
       fill=c("grey70", "blue"), bty='n')
```

The approximate 95% confidence intervals for the Poisson distribution are 18 
to 40 (to nearest whole dragon) with a maximum likelihood estimate of 29 
individuals.

Trondheim.** 

Now you have to create a management recommendation for the local government.

<span style="color:blue"> C1. Produce a recommendation for the government. 
It should include:

* **Why** you suggest this particular option (using analyses to support your reasons). </span>
* **Suggest** some biological reasons for what you have found (i.e. if the population seems lower/higher than you might expect, why could this be? </span>
Does the data you looked at tell you anything about reasons?) </span>
* **Ideas** for future studies you could conduct to understand more about this population, such as </span>
some data you could collect or a question you might want to ask (e.g. do dragons prefer some areas to others?) </span>

# Part D: Reflection and feedback

<span style="color:blue"> D1. How do you think this exercise went? What do
you think your group did well, what was a challenge? 
(2 examples of each) </span>

<span style="color:blue"> D2. What would you like feedback on this 
week? </span>

This question (D2) might be hard to answer, but it will be really helpful if 
you do. We want the feedback we give to be most useful for you! 
You may want feedback
on interpretation, or concepts, or R code, on specific questions, 
or on everything.
It is up to your group
what will be most helpful! You will still get a solution to this exercise so 
you can see
a model answer. 
Therefore, choose feedback that will help beyond the solution. 

**Feedback should
be to help you improve, so let us know what will be most helpful.**
