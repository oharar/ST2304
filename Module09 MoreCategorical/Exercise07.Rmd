# The challenge: How can we maximise plant productivity?

You are a team of agricultural scientists working for a large farming company.
The company has employed you to find out how they can increase the productivity
of their arable (plants) crops. The company don't want to pay for new experiments
but they have given you some older data that you can analyse. The older data
is from two different experiments from 2009 and 1990.

<span style="color:blue"> Your job is to find out how different management
practices influence plant growth and recommend a plan for the company. </span>

# Part A: Dataset one - no interaction

![Meadow](Meadow.jpg){width=50%}

* credit Wikipedia

The first dataset the company has given you can be found at 
https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2019v/Week9/FertilizerData.csv

The data were published in 2009 by Hautier, Niklaus, and Hector 
[Paper link](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5927/636.long).
The study was designed to look at the influence of fertiliser and light on 
grassland plants.
32 different plots were exposed to fertiliser addition, a light addition to 
the understory, neither (control),
or both treatments. The treatments were conducted for two years and above 
ground biomass
collected twice a year to mimic cutting regimes in European meadows.

The dataset includes the variables; **Biomass.m2** the above ground biomass 
of grassland plants
in grams per metre squared, **Fert** a column indicating if the plots had 
fertiliser treatment,
**Light** a column indicating if the plots had light addition.

As always, the first step is to import the data and assign it to an object 
then **plot it**. You can use the whole
web link above to import the data. It is a csv file with column names 
(header) included.

**`pairs()` should work here.**

You might also want to relevel the factors (Fert and Light) to make
sure that the contrast level will be the control treatment 
(light and fertiliser = FALSE).

To do this you use the function `relevel()`. The arguments it takes are the column
name of the factor/categorical variable that you want to relevel and `ref=` the
level that you want to be the reference e.g. 
`FertData$Light <- relevel(FertData$Light, ref="L-")`.

**You will also need to turn BOTH Light and Fert into factors using 
`as.factor()`**. This was done in the module from week 9. 

```{r ReadData, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
FertData <- read.csv("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2019v/Week9/FertilizerData.csv", header=T)

FertData$Light <- as.factor(FertData$Light)
FertData$Fert <- as.factor(FertData$Fert)

#pairs(FertData)
FertData$Fert <- relevel(FertData$Fert, ref="F-")
FertData$Light <- relevel(FertData$Light, ref="L-")
```

Take a look at the plot and think about the data

<span style="color:blue"> A1. **What** is the response variable and **what** are the
explanatory variables here? **What** kind of data are each of these? </span>

In biology, it is always important to think about what we want to find out
before creating a model or doing
analyses.  

<span style="color:blue"> A2. **Write** a biological question 
(e.g. does temperature influence
lay date in birds?) that you
can answer using the data you have here. </span>

Now that you have a biological question, your team wants to create a model of the data.
You can do this using `lm()`. It is important to remember that this time there are two
explanatory variables, so both need to be included in the model. For now we will include
them without an interaction. 

<span style="color:blue"> A3. **Run** the `lm()` to look at the impact of
fertiliser and light on above ground biomass. **What** are the coefficient estimates you get? 
**What** do they represent? </span>


```{r MainEffs, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# run the model
FertModel <- lm(Biomass.m2 ~ Fert + Light, data = FertData)

# get the coefficient estimates
#coef(FertModel)

# and the confidence intervals
#confint(FertModel)
```

<span style="color:blue"> A4. **Interpret** the results in qu A3. **What**
conclusions would you draw about the effectiveness of Fertiliser
and Light from these results? </span>

Given the results from your `lm()` above, it was not possible to see
the combined effect of the two treatments (Fertiliser and Light). 
However, there was a treatment where they were both applied together
so we should consider their combined effect. 

<span style="color:blue"> A5. **How** can you use your model
output to estimate the mean of the group that has fertiliser and light? </span>

<details><summary>Hint.</summary>

In the output you have an estimate for the effect of fertiliser (difference
in mean from control to fertiliser group). You also have an estimate
of the effect of light (difference in mean from control to light group).
In this model there is no interaction, so you assume that the fertiliser + light
group has the same effects as the fertiliser only and light only, but, both of them.

</details>

<span style="color:blue"> A6. Calculate the actual mean of the fertiliser + light 
group. Is the estimate you got in A5 correct? If not, why not? </span>

<details><summary>How do I get the mean?</summary>

You can use the same code as in the module this week. Hint: it uses
`[]` and `==`.

<details><summary>No, I don't remember</summary>

```{r Means, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# take mean of the group F+ and L+
mean(FertData$Biomass.m2[FertData$Fert == "F+" & FertData$Light == "L+"])
```
</details>

</details>

<span style="color:blue"> A7. Can you give a biological reason why this
might be the case? i.e. why does the actual mean differ from our model estimate?</span>

Your team has looked at the results above and decided that the first model
they fitted is not capturing the effects of Fertiliser and Light well enough.
There seems to be something else going on when the two treatments are combined.
The two effects are not simply added together. Therefore, your team decides to 
fit a model including an interaction term. 

# Part B: Dataset one - interaction

<span style="color:blue"> B1. **Run** a `lm()` with an interaction and **interpret** the output. 
How has this changed from the first `lm()` you ran? </span>


```{r Interactions, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
FertModel2 <- lm(Biomass.m2 ~ Fert*Light, data=FertData)

#coef(FertModel2)
#confint(FertModel2)

# save the coefficients as an object 
coefficients <- coef(FertModel2)
# the first number in the coefficients is the mean of the control
# then the effect of fertiliser, the effect of Light
# finally the interaction

# The additive assumption for fertiliser + Light group =
# coefficients[1]+coefficients[2]+coefficients[3]

# Including the interaction = 
# coefficients[1]+coefficients[2]+coefficients[3]+coefficients[4]

# which gives the actual mean of that group
```

<span style="color:blue"> B2. **Describe** the interaction effect
in your own words. You might want to draw out the effects to help. </span>

<span style="color:blue"> B3. **What** would you recommend to the 
company as a strategy to maximise their production based on the results
you have so far? </span>

# Part C: Dataset two

![Soya bean](Soybean.jpg){width=50%}

* credit = Wikipedia

The second dataset that your team has access to is from Heggestad and Lesser (1990).
This was published in a study in the Journal of Environmental Quality 
[Paper link](https://doi.org/10.2134/jeq1990.00472425001900030022x).

The data are from an experiment looking at the effects of low-level atmospheric
pollution and drought on agricultural yields. Specifically this study looked at
yields in soya bean plants and included treatments of water (either well watered or 
low water - i.e. water stressed) and a gradient of an atmospheric pollutant (sulphur dioxide).

The variables in the data are **Yield** log of the yield of the crop, 
**Water** the water treatment either Well-watered or
Stressed and **SO2** sulphur dioxide level (**remember it is O not zero!**)

The data can be found at 
https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2019v/Week9/PollutionData.csv

As always, the first step is to import the data and assign it to an object then **plot it**. You can use the whole
web link above to import the data. It is a csv file with column names (header) included.

**Again, you will need to convert some columns to factors. This time it is 
only the `Water` column.**

```{r PolutionData, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
PollutionData <- read.csv("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2019v/Week9/PollutionData.csv", 
                          header=TRUE)
PollutionData$Water <- as.factor(PollutionData$Water)

#pairs(PollutionData)
```

<span style="color:blue"> C1. **What** is the response variable and **what** are the
explanatory variables here? **What** kind of data are each of these - give 
a reason why? </span>

**Hint: think carefully about whether values between the ones you have can exist.**

You can also check how they are stored in R, anything stored as `num` should be 
continuous numeric. 

<span style="color:blue"> C2. **What** is the biological question you want
to address with these data? </span>

You realise that you can, again, address this question using an `lm()`
You decide to keep things simple and not include an interaction. 

<span style="color:blue"> C3. **Run** an `lm()` for the effect of 
water stress and sulphur dioxide on yield. Look at the output (do not interpret yet)
can you work out what the coefficients mean in terms of a regression line? </span>

**Hint: Think carefully about what kind of data each variable is. This
will decide what its coefficient estimate means.**

```{r PollutionModel, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
PollutionModel <- lm(Yield ~ Water+SO2, data = PollutionData)

#coef(PollutionModel)
#confint(PollutionModel)
```

It could be easier to see the effects on a graph. 
Below is some code to plot of the effect
of SO2 on Yield with a line for each treatment level (Well-watered and Stressed).

This is the same as some code you used in the module for week 9.

```{r PLotSO2, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# make the plot of the data
plot(Yield ~ SO2, data = PollutionData, pch=16, 
     las=1, ylab="log Yield")
# las = 1 makes the y axis numbers display horizontal

# add lines for each group (watered/stressed)
abline(a=coef(PollutionModel)[1], b=coef(PollutionModel)[3], col="grey")
abline(a=coef(PollutionModel)[1]+coef(PollutionModel)[2], 
       b=coef(PollutionModel)[3], col="blue")

# add a legend
legend("topright", c("Well-watered", "Stressed"), col=c("blue","grey"),
       lty=1, cex = 0.5)

# if you aren't sure what the code does, try running just one part at a time
# e.g. coef(PollutionModel)[1] to see what it does
```

<span style="color:blue"> C4. **Interpret** the output of your `lm()` using
the coefficients and the plot. </span>

**While there are only 3 values for SO2 it is NOT categorical data.**

**Hint: look at the numbers given in coefficient values and try to match
them to the graph. This will help you work out what the (Intercept) and
Well-watered values mean.**

# Part D: Recommendation
