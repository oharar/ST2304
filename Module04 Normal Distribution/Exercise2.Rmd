# Instructions:

This document contains information, questions, R code, and plots.

**Hints and reminders are bold**

<span style="color:blue"> Questions appear in blue. </span>

**Exercise to be handed in by Sunday 9th February 2025 at midnight (if this is not 2025, you will need to invent a time machine first)**

## Rationale:

To complete this exercise you will need to use:

* The theory you have been taught in the
lectures
* The R code you have been given in the intro
* The R help pages and google
* Some biological knowledge
* A bit of creativity and problem solving

**This week the exercise looks at how we can use maximum likelihood estimation for distributions
that use two parameters to
make a life saving (or not) decision.** These exercises will get you to use
all steps in statistical modelling (choosing models, estimating parameters, estimating 
uncertainty, and interpretation of results.)

# R hints and general help

## Question vocabulary: 

* **Describe** is asking you to summarise some outputs or findings e.g. 
"X is larger than Y" or "X has a straight line relationship with Y with some outliers" 
or "The confidence interval is 2.4 to 3.1"
* **Interpret** is asking you to take what you can describe and put it
into context (especially back into the units it was calculated from) 
e.g. "X is larger than Y by 5 days, this means that..." or
"X has a straight line relationship with Y of 1.5 degrees to every day change in X. 
This shows that it will be 10.5 degrees warmer at the end of the week" or 
"The confidence interval is 2.4 to 3.1, meaning we are 95% confident that the population
mean lies between these values. The CI does not span zero so we are confident our
estimate is statistcally different to zero."
* **Your opinion** if we ask what you think then we need an opinion as an answer. 
Give reasons to your answer, there may not be a clear wrong or right. But you
should use data available to back up your opinion. 

## Resources:

* Chapter 3 in 'The New Statistics with R'
* Google (or any other search engine)
* Recap maximum likelihood estimation and parameter distributions
* Recap t-tests

## R this week:

New functions:

* `lm()` takes the arguments x, and y e.g. `lm(y ~ x)` x and y here correspond to an 
explanatory variable (x) and a response (y)
* `confint()` gives confidence intervals for an object created using the `lm()` function. Uses t-distribution.
* `summary()` produces a summary of an object created using the `lm()` function.
* `exp()` computes the exponential function, takes e to the power of the number in (). Opposite of taking natural log.
* `sapply()` repeats a function across a vector of values e.g. `sapply(seq(1,10,1), sqrt)` takes the squareroot of numbers 1 to 10 in order
and produces an output of 10 numbers. 

# The challenge: Should you try to outrun a zombie?

It is day 40 after the event. An infection has been spreading through the world.
Its symptoms produce a zombie-like state of reduced cognitive function coupled with
increased aggression. 50% of the population have already been infected. It is not known how many are immune.

**You are a group of statisticians who have managed to remain safe inside your office.
You now need to decide whether to stay here or try and run to a different location.**
But, can you outrun the zombies? From TV and film you have pieced together mixed information 
on zombie abilities. Some sources suggest zombies are slow, only walking or shuffling.
Others show that zombies can move incredibly fast, even running. The only way we can
find out how these zombies behave is with **data**.

Luckily! One of your team has a dataset that might help. 

One infection outbreak began at the 2018 athletics tournament in Paris. 
The 100m final had been run two days before
when an outbreak occurred during the 100m relay. For some reason the newly infected 
athletes still decided to run the relay event (we don't know why). So you have data
on the 100m times for the same runners both before and after infection. 

![Zombie picture](Zombies.png)

The data can be found here: 
https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2023v/Module04/Ztimes100.csv

**It is your job to analyse the data and decide whether to run or stay.**


# Part A: Should you stay or go? using the t-distribution

The first step is to import the data and assign it to an object. You can use the whole
web link above to import the data. It is a csv file with column names (header) included.

```{r ReadData, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
Ztimes100 <- read.csv("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2023v/Module04/Ztimes100.csv", header=T)
```

Once you have imported the data it is important to look at it. 
We have made two graphs for you (you do not need to know all the code used to do it).
In **Figure a** the grey lines show which times are from the same athlete. The means are marked in red.
You can also look at the raw data in R to get familiar with the column names and layout.

**Figure b** is a histogram of the difference in time before and
after being infected. The x-axis is the difference in seconds and
the y-axis is the frequency that difference was observed in the data. 

```{r PlotData, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
# To make the plot it is easier if we re-organise our data
# we want to have a column indicating if the time was before or after
# infection and a column with all the times.

# We do this by making a data frame.
# We will code before and after as 0 and 1 to make plotting easier.
# 0 = before, 1 = after. We use rep to repeat 0 and 1 ten times each.
# We join together the before and after times into new column Times.
# Athlete is created by repeating 1 to 10 twice.
Ztimes100_2 <- data.frame(Group = rep(c(0,1), each = 10),
                          Times = c(Ztimes100$times_before, 
                                    Ztimes100$times_after),
                          Athlete = rep(1:10, 2))

# Then plot all of the data
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
# xaxt = 'n' tells R not to draw an x axis, we will do this ourselves
plot(Ztimes100_2$Group, Ztimes100_2$Times, pch = 16, xaxt = 'n',
     xlim = c(-0.5,1.5), ylim = c(5,15), xlab = "Group", ylab = "Time (seconds)",
     main="a.")
# draw the x axis (side = 1) and give appropriate labels
axis(side = 1, at = c(0,1), labels = c("Before", "After"))

# Then mark on the means in red
points(c(0,1), c(mean(Ztimes100$times_before),
                 mean(Ztimes100$times_after)), col="red", pch = 4, lwd=3)
# to do this we loop through the 10 values of before and after
# we make the line grey
for(i in 1:10){
  lines(c(0,1), c(Ztimes100$times_before[i], Ztimes100$times_after[i]),
        col = "grey50")}

hist(Ztimes100$times_after-Ztimes100$times_before,
     col="grey50", xlab="Difference in times \n(seconds)", las=1, main="b.",
     xlim=c(-1,2.5))
```

The first step when deciding how to analyse the data is to choose
a model to represent how the data were generated. 

**Remember: When deciding how to model any data, you need to consider the characteristics
of the data and match these to an equation or distribution.**

In this case you have data that are differences in times, 
time is continuous (it can take any value, even negative here). You can
also see in Figure b above that the data are almost bell-shaped. Our
data seem to be **normally distributed - they follow a normal distribution 
at the population level.**

The normal distribution is characterised by two parameters:

* The mean ($\mu$)
* The variance ($\sigma^2$)

In this case you are only interested in the mean. You want to estimate
the value of the mean ($\hat{\mu}$) using maximum likelihood estimation.
**Remember that the distribution of those estimates of the mean ($\hat{\mu}$)
will be a t-distribution**. More on this later in the exercise.

In this example the distribution of the data and the parameter are not
the same! Look at the conceptualisation lecture if you need reminding of the
differences between these.
 
The t-distribution has a single parameter;
**the variance**, which is defined by the degrees of freedom (calculated as sample size -1). 
The mean of the t-distribution is equal to 0.

In this example today you want to use your model to answer
a specific question **Are zombies faster than
humans?** 

In order to do this you will be doing the equivalent of a paired t-test. 
You should have covered this
in ST0103 during 'hypothesis testing (in practice)'. But here we will look
at this from a modelling perspective and put it in the framework of the
rest of this course. 

To pair the data you will need to create an object which contains the difference in the times before and
after infection. To do this you need to subtract one column from the other.

<span style="color:blue"> 
A1. **Create** the object of differences in time. Why does the data need to be paired like this? </span>

<span style="color:blue"> A2. What are you trying to find out by modelling these differences? 
(What do you want to know from the data and how can you find
that out? i.e. what criteria would you use to decide on the answer to the question?) </span>  


You can model the data in R using the `lm()` function.

The `lm()` function uses maximum likelihood estimation but R
does all of the estimating for you. It then gives you a summary of the
maximum likelihood estimate for each parameter (the mean) and a measure
of uncertainty (the standard error or confidence intervals - using the t-distribution).

You will need two arguments to give to `lm()`, these are `x` and `y`.

`y` is the object of differences you made in A1. This will make the data paired. These times will be argument `y`, which
is the response variable. 

**Which column you substracted from the other will influence how you interpret the answer.**

**Remember: to assign the differences to an object.**

```{r CalcDiff, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Create a vector of paired differences
# the - symbol automatically subtracts each element of a vector from the
# same location in another vector (creates paired differences)
differences <- Ztimes100$times_before - Ztimes100$times_after
```

Argument `x` here is 1. This is because you are looking only at the mean difference. 
There is no 
explanatory variable. By taking the difference in times rather than the
raw times themselves, you only model the differences.

<span style="color:blue"> A3. Run the model using the `lm()` function. </span> 

Look at the results using `summary(lm_output)` **Remember to replace 'lm_output' with
the name of your own `lm()` model!**

The output of the `lm()` using `summary()` displays:

* model you have run
* the quantiles of the residuals (distance between data and estimate)
* values of the coefficient here:

- estimate = estimate of the parameter we are interested in (the mean of the sample)

- Std. Error = the standard error of the estimated parameter (taken from t-distribution)

- t value = the calculated t-statistic

- Pr(>|t|) = probability value

- Significance codes (ignore these)

- Residual error and degrees of freedom - more on these next week

You can also find the confidence intervals for your parameter estimate
based on the t-distribution
using the `confint()` function as in the code below. 

```{r lmTest, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# run a paired t-test on the differences between before and after 100m times.
t_test1 <- lm(differences ~ 1)

# summarise
summary(t_test1)
```

```{r ConfInt, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# We can show the rounded 95% confidence intervals like this
round(confint(YOUR_lm_output),2)
```

<span style="color:blue"> A4. What are the confidence intervals for your estimate of the mean difference (what values are the upper and lower bound)?
**Describe** what they mean statistically. </span>  

<span style="color:blue"> A5. Your team must decide whether to stay or go. **Based on the data
you have analysed, do you decide to try and outrun the zombies?** 
Include reasons and the results in your answer (MLE and confidence intervals). 
**hint: think about what the estimated mean represents in terms of 100m times** </span>
# Part B: Was there a better way to model uncertainty? 

<span style="color:blue"> B1. Do you think you could you have used a normal distribution here
to represent the parameter distribution instead of a t-distribution? Say **why/why not**. Think
about what the difference between a t-distribution and normal distribution is. </span>  


One way to test whether using a normal distribution would be different to a t-distribution, 
is to try it!

<span style="color:blue"> B2. How many unknown parameters does
the normal distribution have? </span>  


To get a likelihood curve for the estimate of the mean of the differences ($\hat{\mu}$) 
in 100m times using a normal distribution, you can use
the `dnorm()` function (similar to what you did last week with the Binomial 
and Poisson distributions). This allows you to calculate the likelihood,
which for a continuous distribution is the **density**. 

Here you create a distribution for the estimated parameter.

**Remember: as you have many data points, you will need to sum the log likelihood for all data points.** 

**You have code to do this in [week 4 module](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2020v/Week04/Lecture4Module.html)**

<details><summary>Code hint</summary>
You used `dnorm()` in the exercise part of this week's lecture.

There is also a function there to sum log likelihoods, you can copy and paste to use that here. It is `CalcNormlogLh()` it takes the arguments: (`mu`, `sigma`, and `data`), `mu` = mean, `sigma` = standard deviation and `data` = observed data.

The function is in this script https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2021v/Week04/NormalDistFunctions.R
</details>


The estimate of the
mean of the differences stays exactly the same as what you
got before, because this part has not changed. It is still the mean of the 
sample. What does change is how we quantify uncertainty.
**So, how does the estimate of uncertainty change?** To find out you need to
calculate the confidence intervals. 

<span style="color:blue"> B3. **Calculate** the confidence intervals for
the estimate of $\hat{\mu}$ using the normal distribution (code below). </span> 

```{r CIs, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
# Calculate the confidence intervals using a normal distribution 

# First save an object that is the standard error
standard_error_norm <- sd(differences)/sqrt(length(differences))

# Then + or - 1.96 times the standard error from the 
# maximum likelihood estimate
CI_upper <- mean(differences) + 1.96*standard_error_norm
CI_lower <- mean(differences) - 1.96*standard_error_norm

# display the confidence intervals to 2 decimal places
round(c(CI_lower, CI_upper),2)
```

<span style="color:blue"> B4. **Compare** these confidence intervals those calculated
from the t-distribution? </span>  

You should have those written down from 
question A4. 

You can also plot the difference confidence intervals.
Here we plot them both on the Normal distribution density plot. The code to do this is below - it isn't something you need to memorise but do read the comments if you want to understand what it does.

<details><summary>Code</summary>
```{r PLotty, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, include = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# First we write a short function that lets us sum the 
# log likelihoods for all data points to give one
# likelihood measure for the whole dataset

# this line sets up the function
Likelihood_calculation <- function(data, mean, sd) { 
  # this line sums the log likelihoods
  likelihood <- sum(dnorm(data, mean, sd, log=TRUE))
  # this line returns the likehood for the whole dataset
  return(likelihood)
}

# next set up a vector of different mean values to 
# get the likelihood for
means <- seq(-3,3,0.01)

# Now use the 'Likelihood_calculation' function we made earlier.
# Use it inside a function called sapply.
# You don't need to know much about this function,
# but it runs another function for all values of a vector (here 'means')
likelihoods.norm <- sapply(means, Likelihood_calculation, 
                           data = differences, sd = sd(differences))

# We can look at a few of the likelihoods (exp back transforms the log)
head(exp(likelihoods.norm))

# WOW! Those are really small numbers. 
# So when we plot we subtract the maximum likelihood to scale the 
# numbers and make them a bit more relatable. (scaled 0 to 1) 
# First create a plot with the Normal distribution density.
# We use xlim and ylim to set the limits of our axes to make
# the plot look nicer and be easier to read. 
plot(means, exp(likelihoods.norm-max(likelihoods.norm)), 
     type="l", ylab="Density", xlab="Mean", xlim = c(-3,3), ylim=c(0,1.1))
# We then add a point for the maximum likelihood estimate of the mean.
points(mean(differences), 1, col = "red", pch=16)

# Then add the t-distribution confidence intervals in red
abline(v = c(confint(t_test1)[1], confint(t_test1)[2]), col = "red")
# and the Normal distribution confidence intervals in blue
abline(v = c(CI_lower, CI_upper), col = "blue")

# The final step is a legend to explain the colour scheme
# bty = 'n' just means there will be no box around the legend
legend("topright", c("Normal CI", "t CI"), bty = "n",
       lty= c(1,1), col = c("blue", "red"))
```

<span style="color:blue"> B5. Now you have tried the Normal distribution,
do you think the Normal distribution is a good model for the uncertainty in your parameter estimate? 
**Why/Why not** In what situation might it become better? </span>  


<span style="color:blue"> B6. Consider the Normal distribution
confidence intervals. If you use these only, would it change your decision to
run or stay (question A5)? **Explain** your answer </span>

# Part C: Reflection

When modelling, it is always important to consider how good our model
and our data are. 

<span style="color:blue"> C1. What other data might you want to improve your decision making?
Could there be any problems with the current study design? </span>
