# Dataset 1: Cow diets

<span style="color:purple"> Answers in purple </span>

<span style="color:purple"> These answers are like those on a grading scheme
for an exam. You should be able to score your own work or you could
swap with someone else to grade each other's. Hopefully this can give an 
idea of how marks are assigned in exams. </span>

These data are from an experiment on cows. Cows were
split into 6 groups, each given a different diet treatment. Here you will look at
how these different treatments influenced the dry matter intake (DMI) of the cows.

You can find the data [here](https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2020v/Week09/cowdata.csv) it is a .csv with a header.

**Important! When you import the data it is important to make sure it is 
in the right format. Here you need Treatment to be a factor and Baseline to be numeric.
See code below.**

```{r Data, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
cowdata <- read.csv("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/ST2304/2020v/Week09/cowdata.csv", header=T)

# str() checks the data structure
str(cowdata)

# we can see that the variables are not the right format
# so we fix it
cowdata$Treatment <- as.factor(cowdata$Treatment)
cowdata$Baseline <- as.numeric(cowdata$Baseline)

# now check again
str(cowdata)
```

The columns in the dataframe are: 

* DMI = the dry matter intake during the experiment (grams)
* Baseline = the baseline dry matter intake before the experiment (grams)
* Treatment = the diet treatment group (1 to 6)

**You want to find out how diet treatment influenced dry matter intake while
controlling for the baseline intake of each cow.**

<span style="color:blue"> 1. What model will you use to answer this? (1 mark) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 point for any of: linear model, regression, ancova.
No points for anova or t-test. 
There is because there is one categorical and one continuous explanatory here. 
A linear model
that could be viewed as an ancova is maybe most correct but the maths is the 
same as a regression so that is allowed too. </span>

<span style="color:blue"> 2. What type of variables do you have and which 
are response
or explanatory? (3 marks) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 point for each of: DMI = response, continuous. 
Treatment = explanatory, categorical. Baseline = explanatory, continuous. </span>

We have given code to run a model for the data below. 
Think about what type of model is being
run? It is good practice to consider if you would have chosen the same one.

```{r Model1, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Model 1
model1 <- lm(DMI ~ Treatment+Baseline, data = cowdata)

coef(model1)

confint(model1)
```

<span style="color:blue"> 3. Interpret the output of the model. 
What does it tell you
about the effect of diet on DMI? (5 marks) </span> 

<span style="color:purple"> 1 mark for: Intercept is intercept of the model line 
(Y value when Baseline = 0) for 
Treatment group 1.
1 mark for: effect of Baseline intake is positive 
(cows that ate more before eat more
during the experiment coefficient estimate of `r round(coef(model1)[7],2)` 
95% CI = `r round(confint(model1)[7,1],2)` to `r round(confint(model1)[7,2],2)` 
grams per gram). 
1 mark for: the effect of Baseline intake is the same for all groups. 
1 mark for: all treatments
2-6 seem to have a negative effect relative to Treatment group 1 (mention the
actual estimate of effect). 1 mark for:
the confidence intervals cross 0 for groups 2,3,4, and 6 so the effects do not
have a clearly distinguishable direction of effect. 
Only group 5 has a distinguishable 
difference from group 1 estimate = `r round(coef(model1)[5],2)`,
(95% CI `r round(confint(model1)[5,1],2)` to 
`r round(confint(model1)[5,2],2)`grams).
**To get each mark you should mention confidence intervals 
and the coefficient estimate for specific effects.** </span>

Below is the code to make some graphs to check the model fit. 

```{r Plot1, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Graph 1

residuals <- residuals(model1)
fitted <- fitted(model1)
plot(fitted, residuals)

qqnorm(residuals)
qqline(residuals)
```

<span style="color:blue"> 4. What are the assumptions of the model? (5 marks) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 mark each for: linearity, equal variance 
(homoscedasticity - spelling not counted!!), independence of data points,
no outliers, normality of residuals. Could also include mean of residuals = 0. </span>

<span style="color:blue"> 5. Are the assumptions met? Reference which plot you use to decide and
why you make the choice. (6 marks) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 3 marks for: Yes - equal variance, 
tested using residuals vs fitted plot
and there is no structure there. 
Also 3 marks for: Yes - normality of residuals, tested
using normal qq, fall mostly along the line, some deviation at edges. 
For both, could argue that assumptions are not met as there is some 
deviation from perfection, but it is not strong. Would need to say
exactly where the deviations are e.g. for low values in the normal
qq plot and slightly higher variance at fitted values 23 and 24 in the 
residuals vs fitted plot. Could suggest a slight curve in the
residuals vs fitted as more points above 0 on left than right of graph. </span>

<span style="color:blue"> 6. What other plot might you also want for checking assumptions? (1 mark) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 mark: cook's distance. Scale and leverage could 
also be accepted but would be unexpected as an answer. </span>

Here is code for another model on the same data.

```{r Model2, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# Model 2
model2 <- lm(DMI ~ Treatment*Baseline, data = cowdata)

coef(model2)

confint(model2)
```

<span style="color:blue"> 7. How is this model different to the first one? (1 mark) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 mark: this model now has an interaction between
treatment and baseline intake. </span>

<span style="color:blue"> 8. Given the new model, does this change your
interpretation of the effect of diet on DMI? Why? (4 marks) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 mark for: yes. 
1 mark for: Treatment 5 no longer
has a clear effect as the confidence intervals now span 0 (95% CI = 
`r round(confint(model2)[5,1],2)` to `r round(confint(model2)[5,2],2)` ). 
1 mark for: the effect of baseline
has decreased and confidence intervals also now span 0, estimate of effect =
 `r round(coef(model1)[7],2)`
(95% CI 
`r round(confint(model1)[7,1],2)` to `r round(confint(model1)[7,2],2)` ). 
1 mark for:
all other effects have similar interpretation, there does not seem to be 
a statistically distinguishable interaction between baseline intake and 
treatment. All estimates for the differences in the slope of the effect of
baseline intake within each treatment had confidence intervals that spanned 0. 
**Important to know
here that the interaction terms tells you a difference in the slope 
of the effect of baseline on DMI.** </span>

<span style="color:blue"> 9. Which model do you prefer, why? (4 marks) </span>

<span style="color:purple"> 1 mark for: I prefer model 1. 
1 mark for: because it had
clearer estimates of some effects. 
1 mark for: model 2 could not identify the
direction of any effects (confidence intervals spanning 0). 
1 mark for:
as none of the interaction terms had a clear direction, 
I could conclude the interaction
was not needed. I do not think you would be able to justify choosing model 2. </span>
